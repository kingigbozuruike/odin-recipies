    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups very cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Demerara sugar</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plum brandy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fillings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
        <li>2/3 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Demerara sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apricot jam</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners sugar for dusting, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour and butter to a large bowl, and use your fingertips to rub butter into flour 
            until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs with no large lumps of butter remaining.</li>
        <li>Add the 1/4 cup Demerara sugar, egg yolks, sour cream, and brandy to flour mixture and 
            combine with a spatula just until the dough comes together. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place apples, raisins, the 1/3 cup Demerara sugar, vanilla sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a 
            simmer over medium-low heat and simmer until apples are tender, and mixture is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x16-inch baking pan with parchment. </li>
        <li>Divide the chilled dough into two equal pieces. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into 2 9x16-inch rectangles. 
            Place one of the rectangles into the prepared baking pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a pale crust develops on top, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Carefully brush the semi-baked crust with apricot jam. Evenly distribute filling over the crust. Place the 
            second rectangle of dough on top and prick it all over with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake until crust is lightly browned and filling is hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove to a wire rack, and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Dust the still-warm pie with confectionerâ€™s sugar, 
            cut into squares, and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
